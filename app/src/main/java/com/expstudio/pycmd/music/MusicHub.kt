 * going when the screen does not. Everything the UI knows about playback comes
 * out of [playback], which is refreshed from the controller's own callbacks
 * rather than guessed at: the notification, a headset button and the lock
 * screen can all change what is playing without this app being involved, and a
 * screen that tracked its own idea of "playing" would be wrong within seconds.

 * The connection is made when there is music to play, not unconditionally at
 * startup: binding a media service on a phone whose library is empty would put
 * a player in the notification shade of somebody who never opened the tab.
