 * Replacing the installed app with a newer build, without uninstalling it.

 * things line up: the same package name, the same signing key, and a
 * versionCode that is not lower. Get all three and the workspace, the installed
 * packages and every setting stay exactly where they are - the app is upgraded
 * underneath them. Miss the signature and the installer refuses with "App not
 * installed", which leaves uninstall-first as the only way in, and uninstalling
 * is precisely what takes the workspace with it.
 *
 * So this checks both before it offers to install anything, rather than letting
 * the system installer be the one to break the news. The repo now carries a
 * fixed signing key for the same reason (see keystore/ and app/build.gradle.kts):
 * Gradle's per-machine debug key would have made every build a different app.
 *
 * The download is verified against the SHA-256 in the manifest before it is
 * offered. That check is what makes an update safe to take: the manifest comes
 * over HTTPS, and the hash in it is what says the bytes that arrived are the
 * bytes that were published.
