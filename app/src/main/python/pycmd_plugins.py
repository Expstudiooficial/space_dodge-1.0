"""The custom-plugin runtime: install, load, run, and talk to the UI.

A plugin is Python that the app imports into its own interpreter, plus an
optional HTML panel that becomes a tab. That is the whole idea, and its cost
has to be said plainly rather than buried: a plugin runs with exactly the
permissions the app has. It can read and write the workspace, open sockets,
and install packages. There is no sandbox, because CPython does not have one
worth the name - `exec` in a stripped namespace stops nobody who can spell
``__builtins__``. The app therefore does the only honest thing: it says so
before installing, on a screen the user has to read.

Three shapes are accepted:

* ``thing.py``            - one file, with a ``PLUGIN = {...}`` dict in it.
* ``thing/``              - a folder with ``plugin.json`` and an entry module.
* ``thing.zip``           - the same folder, zipped.

See PLUGINS.md for the authoring guide; this module is the other half of that
document, and the two are meant to be read together.
