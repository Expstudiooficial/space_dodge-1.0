# Prebuilt APK

`PyCmd-1.0-debug.apk` — ready to install, nothing else needed.

| | |
|---|---|
| Package | `com.expstudio.pycmd.debug` |
| Version | 1.0-debug |
| Size | 32 MB |
| Signed with | the standard Android debug key |
| Works on | Android 7.0 (API 24) and newer, **arm64-v8a** (every phone since about 2016) |
| SHA-256 | see [SHA256SUMS.txt](SHA256SUMS.txt) |

This exact build was installed and run on an Android 11 emulator before being
committed: the app launches, CPython 3.13.9 starts, and running the editor's
starter script prints its output to the console. See the main README for what
that check does and does not cover.

It is a debug build, so it is already signed and installs without any keystore
or Play Store involvement. It also carries the `.debug` package suffix, which
means it can sit alongside a release build of the same app without either one
replacing the other.

## Installing it on a phone

1. Download the APK onto the phone (or copy it across by USB).
2. Open it from the Files app or the download notification.
3. Android will ask whether to allow installs from this source — that prompt
   appears for any app that did not come from a store. Allow it, then confirm
   the install.
4. Launch **PyCmd**.

The first launch takes a few seconds longer than later ones: the Python
interpreter and its standard library are unpacked on that first run. The title
bar shows `starting` until it is ready, then switches to `Python 3.13.x`.

Once it's running, see [../TUTORIAL.md](../TUTORIAL.md) for a walkthrough of
every tab with things to paste in and try.

## Installing over USB

```bash
adb install -r dist/PyCmd-1.0-debug.apk
```

## Checking the download

```bash
sha256sum -c dist/SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## A note on the device requirement

This APK carries **arm64-v8a** binaries only, which is what keeps it to 32 MB
rather than 46 MB. Every Android phone sold in roughly the last decade is
arm64, so this is the right build for a real device.

Two cases need a different build. A 32-bit-only phone from before about 2016
cannot run it at all: Chaquopy's Python 3.13 runtime ships no 32-bit binaries.
An **x86_64 emulator** needs the x86_64 slice, which the default build
produces:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug      # both ABIs, one APK per ABI plus a universal one
```

## Rebuilding it yourself

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -Ppycmd.abi=arm64-v8a
# -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Leave the property off to build for both ABIs instead.

See the [main README](../README.md) for what the build needs.
