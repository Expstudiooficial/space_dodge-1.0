"""Writes and checks `dist-windows/latest.json`.

The Windows twin of `tools/make_latest.py`, and separate from it on purpose:
the exe and the APK are different artefacts on different schedules, and one
manifest describing both would eventually offer somebody the wrong one.

    python tools/make_latest_windows.py dist-windows/PyCmd-1.0.0.exe --notes "..."
    python tools/make_latest_windows.py          # just check what is there

Called with no arguments it verifies rather than writes: that the manifest
points at a file that exists, that its size and checksum match that file, and
that its build number agrees with the source. That check runs in the suite, so
a manifest that has drifted away from its exe is a red line rather than a
download that fails for somebody else.

#   `latestUrl` always redirects to whatever the newest release is. That is
#   the one to put on a website or hand somebody, and it is deliberately not
