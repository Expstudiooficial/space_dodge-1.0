"""Checks the music library: tracks, playlists, order, and what survives.

Playback is Kotlin and needs a phone, so none of it is here. Everything that
decides *what* plays and *in what order* is Python, and all of that is
checkable on a laptop: importing, naming, playlists, moving a track up,
deleting one out from under a playlist, and a registry that survives being
reloaded from disk.

The audio is not real audio - a few bytes with the right extension. Nothing in
this module opens a file to decode it, and a test that needed a real MP3 to
check that a rename works would be testing the wrong thing.
