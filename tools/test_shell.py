"""Checks the console's command layer.

Two things matter here and they pull against each other: the commands have to
work, and they must never take a line that was Python. Most of this file is
the second half - `ls` is a command, `ls = [1]` is an assignment, and a console
that gets that wrong is worse than one with no commands at all.
