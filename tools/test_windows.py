"""Checks the Windows build, everywhere.

Runs on any machine, including the Linux one this was written on, because
almost nothing here is Windows-specific: the toolchain table is data, the
language registry is data, the host is a dict of functions, and the store is
path arithmetic. What genuinely needs Windows - that the exe opens, that
WebView2 is there - is checked by the GitHub Actions workflow on a Windows
runner, and by `tools/test_toolchains_live.py` beside it.
