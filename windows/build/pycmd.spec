# PyInstaller recipe for PyCmd.exe
#
# One file, no console window, everything the app needs inside it: the shared
# engine, the web assets, the bundled plugins, the guides and the UI.
#
# Run it from the repository root on Windows:
#
#     pip install -r windows/build/requirements.txt
#     pyinstaller windows/build/pycmd.spec --noconfirm
#
# What comes out is dist\PyCmd.exe and nothing else - no folder of DLLs to
# keep beside it, no installer, no registry. That is deliberate: the phone
# build is one APK you can hand somebody, and this should be one exe.
#
# It is not signed here. Signing needs a certificate, which is not something a
# repository can hold, so a downloaded PyCmd.exe will show Windows SmartScreen
# the first time until enough people have run it. FORKING.md says how to sign
# your own build if you have a certificate.
