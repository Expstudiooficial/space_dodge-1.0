"""The window.

PyCmd's UI has always been half web page - the console, the editor, every
plugin panel and the whole preview are HTML in a WebView, and only the chrome
around them was Compose. So the Windows port keeps the half that was already
portable and replaces the half that was not: the chrome becomes HTML too, and
the window is Edge WebView2, which every Windows 10 and 11 machine has.

That choice is what makes this a port rather than a rewrite. `console.js`,
`editor.js`, `highlight.js` and every plugin's `ui.html` are the same files the
phone loads, byte for byte.

**Why there is an HTTP server in here.** The page could be loaded from
`file://`, and then every relative path, every `fetch`, and every plugin panel
would be fighting the browser's rules about local files. Serving the same
folders over `127.0.0.1` on a random high port removes that whole class of
problem, costs a few milliseconds at start-up, and is bound to the loopback
interface so nothing outside the machine can reach it. The token in the URL is
belt and braces: another program on the same machine that guessed the port
still does not get an answer.
