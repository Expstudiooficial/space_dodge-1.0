"""The plugins that ship inside the exe, and the ones you bring from a phone.

Two jobs.

**Installing what shipped.** Five plugins ride along inside the build - Cloud,
Creator, Packages Pro, Scheduler and Server Pro - and land in the plugins
folder on first run so they show up switched off in the list rather than not at
all. The ordering here is the one the phone build learned the hard way in
2.5.7: install *before* anything is loaded, ask the real listing rather than a
half-filled cache, and treat a folder that will not read as out of date so a
damaged plugin repairs itself instead of staying broken.

**Bringing a phone plugin over.** A PyCmd plugin is a folder with a
`plugin.json`, some Python and some HTML - none of which is Android-specific,
because the plugin API never was. So one written for the phone very often just
works here. *Often*, not always, and that is what [inspect_mobile] is for: it
reads a plugin before installing it and says which of its parts this machine
cannot honour, so the warning on the button is a specific one rather than a
shrug.
