"""The workspace, as files on a disk.

The Android build does this in Kotlin - `Workspace.kt` - because on a phone
the workspace is app-private storage and the file picker is a system service.
Neither is true here: the workspace is an ordinary Windows folder, and the
only thing standing between it and Explorer is that PyCmd knows where it is.

So this is the smallest honest file API: list, read, write, make, rename,
delete, and bring a file in from somewhere else on the disk.

**Everything is checked to be inside the workspace.** Not because a local user
cannot reach their own disk - they obviously can, with Explorer - but because
the app has a bridge that a *plugin panel* can reach, and a plugin asking to
read `C:\\Users\\you\\.ssh\\id_rsa` through the app's own file API should get
a refusal rather than a helping hand. The check is the same one the HTTP
server uses: resolve first, then require the result to be inside.
