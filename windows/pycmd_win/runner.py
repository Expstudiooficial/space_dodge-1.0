"""Pressing Run, on Windows.

One job: take a file, work out what runs it, run it, and stream what it says
back a line at a time so the console fills as the program talks rather than
all at once when it stops.

Three things it does that are worth saying out loud:

* **It falls back.** C, Go, Rust and JavaScript have interpreters built into
  PyCmd - the ones the phone build uses, because Android forbids running code
  an app compiled itself. On Windows the real toolchain is tried first and the
  interpreter is what you get when there isn't one. So a fresh install runs a
  .go file on day one, and installing Go makes the same file run on the real
  thing. Nothing about that is hidden: the console says which one ran it.

* **It kills the whole tree.** A build step that spawns a compiler that spawns
  a linker leaves three processes, and `terminate()` on the first one leaves
  the other two. On Windows the job is given to `taskkill /T`.

* **It never uses a shell.** Every command is a list of arguments. A workspace
  under `C:\\Users\\Some One\\Documents` is the normal case, and `shell=True`
  would make it a bug report.
