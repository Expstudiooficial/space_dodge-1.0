"""Where PyCmd keeps things on Windows.

The phone build has this decided for it: an Android app owns exactly one
private folder and everything lives under it. On Windows the choice is ours,
and the convention is unambiguous - per-user application data that is not
worth roaming goes in ``%LOCALAPPDATA%``, so PyCmd's is ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\PyCmd``.

Nothing is written to Program Files, and nothing needs administrator rights.
That is deliberate: an app that asks for elevation to save a script is an app
people stop trusting, and a portable build has to work from a memory stick.

Set ``PYCMD_HOME`` to put the whole lot somewhere else - that is how the
portable build keeps its workspace beside the exe, and how the tests get a
clean tree without touching yours.
