"""Where new versions come from.

The phone build reads ``dist/latest.json`` from the repository and installs the
APK over itself. Windows needs its own manifest, because the two are different
artefacts on different schedules: ``dist-windows/latest.json`` describes the
exe, and nothing here will ever offer somebody an APK.

What this does *not* do is install anything by itself. An app that silently
replaces its own exe while you are using it is an app that eventually replaces
it with something broken while you are using it. PyCmd downloads the new one to
the Downloads folder, checks its hash against the manifest, and tells you where
it is. Replacing the old exe is one deliberate step you take.
